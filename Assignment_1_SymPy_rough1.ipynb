    "\n",
    "SymPy is an open source library released under the BSD Licence (https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause), and is developed and maintained by Aaron Meurer. Its first version, v0.5.13-hg, was released on April 1, 2008, with its latest release of v1.13 on September 14, 2018. The library is programmed purely with Python, and can be used by all Python versions 2.7 and above. It can also be used across all operating systems (https://pypi.org/project/sympy/#history), which distinguishes it from other CAS libraries such as Axiom (https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/SymPy-vs.-Axiom). \n",
    "\n",
    "Since its first release, SymPy has become highly reknowned and popular in scientific and mathematics computing communities. A Github file called \"SymPy Papers\", located at https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/SymPy-Papers, tracks Zotero publications which cite the library. Another Github file in the SymPy repository, https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/Presentations, lists SymPy presentations from conferences across the globe. The repository also provides a list of cookbooks for SymPy: https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/Cookbook, and countless tutorials have been written both by the maintenance team and by external developers and users: https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/External-SymPy-Media%2C-Tutorials%2C-and-Presentations.

    "### Who uses SymPy and What can you do with it?\n",
    "\n",
    "SymPy is designed for use in mathematics, engineering, and physics (https://pypi.org/project/sympy/). It can be used in functions, in various areas of calculus, and in linear algebra: for example, simplifying expressions; computing differentials, integrals, and limits; working with matrices; solving equations. In a nutshell, SymPy can help you pass MATH1310 and MATH1410. For those who aren't York University math and science students, but who happen to be professionals in a STEM field, SymPy can greatly reduce the time and error margin involved in solving complex problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Direct from the main SymPy website, SymPy can be used for: \n",
    "\"plotting, printing (like 2D pretty printed output of math formulas, or LATEX), code generation, physics, statistics, combinatorics, number theory, geometry, logic, and more\" (https://docs.sympy.org/latest/tutorial/intro.html#the-power-of-symbolic-computation).\n",
    "\n",
    "If that doesn't get you excited to do some Python math, I don't know what will.\n",
    "\n",
    "### There are other CAS libraries, so why choose SymPy?\n",
    "\n",
    "Excellent question. That all depends on your mathematical needs. Axiom (http://axiom-developer.org/) is an excellent open source alternative, as a general computer algebra system. It is mostly used by mathematical researchers, whereas SymPy is more often used for scientific research as well as mathematics. Additionally, SymPy is available on more operating systems than Axiom, since it is a pure Python program and requires only Python 2.7 and above (https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/SymPy-vs.-Axiom). Overall, both are good options, but SymPy is more accessible due to its only dependability being Python 2.7 or higher, and it's ease of use: if you're already using Python, you can use SymPy, as its language and syntax are the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Magma (http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/) is another CAS very similar to SymPy and can handle many of the same types of expressions and mathematics. However, Magma does not have the ability to perform plotting, while SymPy, with the addition of another library called Pyglet, can perform sophisticated plots. Magma is also proprietary software, and while a free trial is available, any prolonged use requires purchase of a licence of its latest version, v2.18-2. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additional comparisons between SymPy and similar CAS libraries can be found at https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki#documentation. Many of these are proprietary and require purchase, often upwards of $1000 USD. SymPy, on the other hand, is not only free, but its source code can be altered and sold for profit, according to its BSD licence. \n",
    "\n",
    "SymPy is a highly user-friendly, easy to download and install CAS library with a lot of online support. Depending on your particular mathematical needs, it serves as an ideal choice for symbolic computing. "
